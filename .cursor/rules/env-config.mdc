description: Environment variables and .env usage for AI gateway and Kernel

# Environment & Config

- Required env vars (read in [src/lib/gateway.py](mdc:src/lib/gateway.py)):
  - `AI_GATEWAY_URL`
  - `AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN`

- Create `.env` at repo root. `just` is configured to auto-load it via `dotenv-load` and `dotenv-path` in the [justfile](mdc:justfile).

- For deployments, `just deploy` will pass `--env-file .env` to Kernel so the action can read gateway values at runtime.

- Provider-specific runtime creds (sent in request): `provider`, `model`, `api_key` are part of the request body (`BrowserAgentRequest`). The server does not read provider keys from the environment; they come from the client call and are forwarded through the gateway.
