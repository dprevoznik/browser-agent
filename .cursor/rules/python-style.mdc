# Python Style

- Prefer explicit type hints on public APIs and datamodels.
- Follow Ruff defaults; run `just fmt` before commits.
- Keep imports ordered and minimal; avoid unused imports.
- Use `pydantic` models for request/response schemas.
- Avoid broad `except Exception` unless re-raising or logging with context.
- Keep functions small with early returns; avoid deep nesting.

Environment/versions:

- Python >= 3.13 per [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml).
- Lint/format via Ruff in the [justfile](mdc:justfile).
